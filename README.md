<h1 align="center">Howdy! I'm Moeka ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p align="left">
I'm a Ecology Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University with a focus on forest carbon cycling and allocation, soil carbon dynamics, and soil respiration. By using my research experience and data analysis skills, I am interested in pursuing a career as a data analyst/scientist, solving problems related to the environment, sustainability, and agriculture after completing the degree.
